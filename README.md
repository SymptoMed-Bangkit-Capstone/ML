The evaluation of the machine learning models in Data Science involved a comprehensive analysis using various methods, including Random Forest, Random Forest using hyperparameters, and Shallow Neural Networks (NN). These models were specifically developed to classify data related to different types of diseases and their related symptoms. The accuracy results obtained from each of these machine-learning models are as follows:

  1. Random Forest: The model achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying disease types and symptoms. It demonstrated robust performance in capturing complex patterns within the data and making accurate predictions.
  2. Random Forest using hyperparameters: The use of hyperparameters in the Random Forest model did not significantly differ from the regular Random Forest approach. The accuracy of the model remained at an impressive 98%, which is considered highly satisfactory in terms of prediction accuracy.
  3. Shallow NN: The utilization of a Shallow Neural Network yielded an accuracy of 99%. This model leveraged the power of neural networks to learn intricate relationships within the data, enabling more precise disease classification and symptom identification.

The evaluation results indicate that these machine-learning models have proven to be effective in accurately classifying disease types and symptoms. These findings provide valuable insights for further research and potential applications in the medical field, contributing to improved diagnostics and treatment strategies.
